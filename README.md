A demonstration of a multimodal RAG agent with:  
* [x] Reranking Features
* [ ] Live Search Agent

The implementation is inspired from the NVIDIA GenAI [examples](https://github.com/NVIDIA/GenerativeAIExamples) with some more enhancements on the lines to handle multiple configurations for different stakeholders and using reranking and agent functionalites in order to get more relevant and correct results from the RAG application.
